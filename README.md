# WineQualityLogisticRegression

This project seeks to implement logsitic regression as a means to predict whether a wine's quality is 'Good' or 'Bad' based on the inputs of 11 separate variables.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

Inside this project you'd find:
A description and analysis of the data set.
Implementing a logistic regression model by hand.
Implementing a logisitc regression model using scikit's data science library.
Interface to predict wine quality, labeling a wine as 'Good' or 'Bad', making use of both logistic regression models created.
Interface to update the database, updating the quality of the inputted wine by using the 'By Hand' logistic regression model.

This project was originally produced on jupyter notebook, so there might be some errors from transitioning it onto a basic python file.
